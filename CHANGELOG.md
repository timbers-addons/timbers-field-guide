## v2026.07.23 (2026-07-23)

This release is a full redesign of the addon. The old dropdown-driven window is replaced with browsable pages for classes, professions, and skills, and recipes now carry much richer data: every place you can get them, what they cost, and which content phase unlocks them.

### New
- Rebuilt the navigation as data-driven pages: pick a class, profession, or skill from landing pages instead of dropdown menus
- Redesigned the recipe popup: what it makes, skill-up levels, materials, and every source for the recipe with location, cost, and phase
- Recipes can now list multiple sources (for example a Horde and an Alliance vendor), with your own faction and neutral sources listed first and faction tags colored blue/red
- Recipes are tagged with the content phase they become available in and are hidden until their phase; the popup shows a phase badge
- Magister's Terrace re-issue recipes now also show their original pre-Sunwell sources
- Rogue poisons moved to their own page under the Rogue class instead of the professions list

### Fixed
- Duplicated recipe materials
- Profession known-spell counts, search, and skill-range display
- Flarecore patterns: sold by the Thorium Brotherhood at the listed reputation and price, not dropped from Molten Core trash
- Click outside the recipe popup to close it

### Housekeeping
- Updated for game clients 1.15.9 and 2.5.6
- The addon zip now includes the license
- Reorganized the code and database files internally; documentation moved to the Docs folder
